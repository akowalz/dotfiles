# Dotfiles

This repo includes my configuration files for vim, tmux, bash, git, and more.

## Setup & Install

Use the included setup script to create symlinks from files in this directory to your home directory, where they can be picked up. If any files exist already in your home directory, that link will be skipped.

```sh
./setup.sh
```

The install script will install homebrew, tmux, and vim plugins.

```sh
./install.sh
```
